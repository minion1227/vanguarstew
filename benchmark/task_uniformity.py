"""Gate whether a benchmark task set's tasks are equally weighted (uniform revealed windows).

``taskgen.generate_tasks`` scores the agent at each freeze point against its ``revealed`` window —
the next ``horizon`` commits. Every task contributes one win/loss/tie to the aggregate record, so
the tasks are only comparable, equal-weight samples if they are judged against the **same amount**
of revealed future. A run that mixes a 2-commit revealed window with a 5-commit one conflates
easy and hard scenarios in a single record, undermining the M1 "pairwise win/loss record ...
re-runs are stable" guarantee.

``generate_tasks`` produces uniform windows (its ``usable`` filter requires ``i + horizon <
len(commits)``, so every window is exactly ``horizon`` long), so a non-uniform set signals a
truncated, hand-edited, or horizon-mismatched task file. ``task_integrity`` checks each
``revealed`` window is a non-empty list; ``task_independence`` checks the windows don't overlap.
Neither checks that the windows are the **same length** — this does. The check is on window
*length* only (equal weighting); it does not inspect window *contents*.

``check_task_uniformity(tasks)`` verifies, each check failing closed:

1. ``is_task_list`` — ``tasks`` is a non-empty list whose every entry is an object. A non-object
   entry is **flagged** here (the check fails and the detail reports how many of the entries were
   objects), not silently dropped.
2. ``revealed_windows_present`` — every task's ``revealed`` is a non-empty list (a missing key, an
   empty list, or a non-list all fail);
3. ``uniform_window_length`` — every task's ``revealed`` window has the same length.

A TIME-horizon task set (taskgen's ``horizon_days`` mode) carries its span per task and reports
``uniform_window_span`` instead: there, equal weight means an equal *span*, not an equal commit
count — a 90-day window over a busy month reveals more commits than over a quiet one, and that
variance is the design (a maintainer's week off averages out rather than dominating a 5-commit
sample). Same invariant (equal-weight samples), measured along the horizon's own dimension.

The companion ``scripts/task_uniformity.py`` exits non-zero when the windows are uneven.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates its input, and a malformed/non-list task set simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising. No thresholds — uniformity is judged purely from the set.
