"""Reference baseline maintainers — the opponents a challenger is judged against.

The pairwise judge only means something relative to an opponent. Three are provided:

- ``empty``     — proposes nothing concrete. The floor: any real plan should beat it.
- ``heuristic`` — a deterministic, LLM-free maintainer that extrapolates the repo's own
                  recent behavior: it addresses the open-issue backlog and continues the
                  themes that dominate recent commit history. A stronger, harder-to-beat
                  bar than ``empty`` — a challenger has to actually out-reason "keep doing
                  what this repo has been doing."
- ``queue_first`` — like ``heuristic`` but clears the open-PR **review queue** first, mirroring
                  the planner's own guidance that a strong maintainer clears or explicitly
                  schedules the review queue before unrelated greenfield work. On a repo with a
                  live queue it is the hardest bar; with no queue it degrades to exactly
                  ``heuristic``, so it is never a weaker opponent.

Each baseline exposes the same shape as the agent's ``solve`` output (philosophy + plan +
rationale), so it can flow through ``_submission`` and the judge unchanged. Select one by
name via :func:`get_baseline`; the runner exposes this as ``--baseline``.
