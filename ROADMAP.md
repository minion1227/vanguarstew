# Roadmap & Milestones — vanguarstew (SN74 repo-maintainer agent)

Goal: a general repository-maintainer agent, optimized against a benchmark derived from real GitHub history, mature enough to run fully agentic on gittensor (the way SN66 "ninja" runs for coding). Each milestone has a concrete **deliverable** and an **acceptance test** — done means the acceptance test passes, not "looks done."

---

## M0 — Scaffold & agent contract

The agent runs and returns a well-formed maintainer decision.

- Repo scaffold, packaging, manifest (`vanguarstew_agent_files.json`).
- Base agent with the fixed `solve(repo_path, request, ...)` entrypoint.
- Agent workflow wired: **infer philosophy → read situation → plan/decide → implement-if-needed**.
- OpenAI-compatible LLM client honoring the managed-inference contract (`api_base`/`api_key`/`model`), plus an offline stub for deterministic dry-runs.
- **Acceptance:** `VANGUARSTEW_OFFLINE=1 python -m pytest -q` passes; `solve()` on a frozen repo returns a decision with `philosophy`, `plan`, `action`, `rationale`.

## M1 — Time-travel replay harness

The core loop runs end-to-end on real history.

- `freeze.py`: check out a repo at commit T and build the **knowable-at-T** context, stripping forward-looking signal.
- `taskgen.py`: generate replay tasks from a repo's git history (freeze point + revealed next-N).
- `judge.py`: **pairwise** LLM judge (challenger plan vs. current-best plan, given the revealed trajectory).
- `runner.py`: orchestrate freeze → run agents → judge → tally **decisive wins**.
- **Acceptance:** end-to-end replay on 1–2 *leakage-safe* repos produces a pairwise win/loss record between two agents; re-runs are stable.

## M2 — Scoring dimensions & leakage hardening

The score is defensible, not just subjective prose-judging.

- **Objective anchor:** deterministic scoring of concrete decisions (merge/reject, labels, reviewer, version bump) vs. actual.
- **Judged layer:** trajectory/direction + decision-process rubrics, pairwise; rubric anchoring against fluff.
- **Leakage defenses:** offline sandbox; forward-signal stripping; **repo/time-point selection past model training cutoff**; obscure/private-repo support.
- Richer context via GitHub API (issues, PRs, reviews, releases) where available.
- **Acceptance:** composite score = objective anchor + judged layer; documented leakage controls; an agent that merely restates a memorized outcome does **not** win.

## M3 — Generalization ✅

A *general* maintainer, not one tuned to a single repo.

- [x] Diverse + **held-out** repos: `benchmark/repo_sets/curated.json` (5 repos), repo-set config, `--repo-set` wiring.
- [x] Generalization report: `run_eval --generalization` replays tuned+held-out partitions, reports `generalization_gap`.
- [x] Judge-robustness: disagreement tracking, pairwise judging, evidence anchoring.
- [x] Spot-check / manual review of the top agent (as ninja does).
- [ ] **Acceptance run:** run `--generalization` on the curated set with a current model and confirm `generalization_gap` is reasonable.
- **Status:** code complete. Acceptance run pending — blocked on closing M4 hardening bugs (non-string field crashes prevent a clean multi-repo replay).

## M4 — Hardening & release readiness

Close the crash-and-correctness gap so a full benchmark run completes clean.

- [ ] **Agent hardening:** every field the LLM emits is guarded against non-string types (philosophy, planner, decider, reviewer, judge). Open: #297, #313, #317.
- [ ] **Benchmark scoring:** close module-recall farming (#289), unreachable backlog threshold (#308), composite-score wiring.
- [ ] **Leakage lockout:** tag-scrubbing for git-freeze releases (#245), milestone deep-link masking, forward-reference audit for git-only fallback (#283).
- [ ] **Tooling:** `compare_eval` CLI for diffing replay artifacts (#306), `--fail-under` score floor for CI gating (#315).
- [ ] **Acceptance run:** `run_eval --generalization` on curated set completes clean, zero crashes, `generalization_gap` documented.
- **Acceptance:** benchmark runs clean on 5 diverse repos; no agent crashes from malformed LLM output; leakage audit clean.

## M5 — gittensor integration / subnet launch

Fully on-chain, 66-style.

- Decide reuse vs. fork of `tau` (Generate → Solve → Compare/eval) and its managed inference.
- Register the repo on gittensor (#1578 config: maintainer_cut 0.5, trusted_label_pipeline, label_multipliers).
- Wire the full submit → evaluate → rank loop (subnet economics handled by gittensor).
- **Acceptance:** miners can submit a maintainer agent and have it evaluated and ranked autonomously, end-to-end.
